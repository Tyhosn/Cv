    <h2>Top 5 Dust Two smokes </h2>

    <!-- Number 1 -->
<h2>1. A-Long smoke for T¬¥s (no bind needed)</h2>
<h3><p> Directly target the heart of the mosaic and aim your crosshair at the tip of a palm tree leaf. Once you have established that, click your smoke to cast it into play - this may not be perfectly accurate due to lower ranks yet will still achieve its purpose. 
    In order for this smoke trick to work without any external help or binds, I included it in my guide as it's straightforward and simple enough for anyone too remember!</p></h3>

<!-- Number 2 -->
<h2>2. Easy X-Box Smoke (no bind needed)</h2>
<h3><p>Mastering the X-Box smoke has never been simpler! Align your crosshair with our reference image and aim for the end of the antenna. After releasing your smoke grenade, 
    it should perfectly hit its mark on X-Box! This method is not only secure and effortless to establish, 
    but there are no jump throw binds either -- making this approach suitable even if you lack speed. 
    If you're searching for a reliable yet straightforward way to cast smokescreens over X-Box, then look no further than here!</p></h3

<h2>3. CT Smoke from X-Box</h2>
<h3><p>If you wish to execute a B-Split near the X-Box and are looking for guidance, stand such that only the shadowed portion above the middle doors is visible. 
    Then locate and focus on the tiny dark patch on your left wall; take one small step forward before releasing your smoke.</p></h3>
